# Practical 10
# Reflection
1. Over the course, my ability to estimate task durations improved as I learned more about the factors affecting task complexity. This helped in better planning and management of my time.
2. Participating in code reviews taught me the importance of clear, maintainable code and offered new perspectives and techniques from peers, enhancing my coding skills.
3. If I were in charge, I'd incorporate more collaborative elements into the practical tasks to mirror real-world coding environments and encourage peer learning.
